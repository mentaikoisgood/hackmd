# Midterm 2

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a connected graph with $|V| > 9^9$. Furthermore, let $C = (R, L)$ be a minimum global cut of $G$. It is known that only four edges $G$, namely $e_1, e_2, e_3$ and $e_4$ have one endpoint in $L$ and the other in $R$. Please pick the correct items from below:

A. If Karger’s algorithm contracts none of $e_1, e_2, e_3$ and $e_4$, then it will output $C$.

B. If Karger’s algorithm contracts exactly one of $e_1, e_2, e_3$ and $e_4,$ then it will output $C$.

C. If Karger’s algorithm contracts exactly two of $e_1, e_2, e_3$ and $e_4$, then it will output $C$.

D. If Karger’s algorithm contracts all of $e_1, e_2, e_3$ and $e_4$, then it will output $C$.

E. If every edge contracted by Karger’s algorithm is in $E \setminus {e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4}$, then Karger’s algorithm will output $C$.
